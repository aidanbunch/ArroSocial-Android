## Arro Social Android App
Welcome to the Arro Social Android App, an app designed to connect you with the people and content that matter most to you. This version of the app was developed as part of an internship for the Android version of Arro Social. The app is written in Java and utilizes Firebase Auth/Firestore for its backend.

Arro Social provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface that is easy to use, and you can quickly and easily connect with your friends and family. Although the app isn't fully built out, it has several features that make it a powerful tool for staying connected.

The app file structure is modeled after the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, which helps maintain a clean separation between application logic and the UI, making it easier to test, maintain, and evolve the app. Arro Social's file hierarchy looks something like this:
`app
|-- src/main
|   |-- java/com/aidanbunch/arrosocial
|   |   |-- model  
|   |   |-- utils 
|   |   |-- view  
|   |   |-- viewmodel`
